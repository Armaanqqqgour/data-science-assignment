    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Code Reusability: The derived class can reuse the code from the base class, reducing duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Code Organization: It promotes code organization by maintaining a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Efficiency: Single inheritance requires a small runtime due to less overhead.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Code Reuse from Different Sources: Multiple inheritance enables code reuse from different base classes, promoting flexibility.\n",

    "1) In single inheritance, the derived class inherits from a single base class. In multiple inheritance, the derived class inherits from two or more base classes.\n",
